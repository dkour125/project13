# 📈 Volatility Forecasting in India 🇮🇳

This project focuses on forecasting the **volatility of Indian financial assets** using a **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)** time series model. The goal is to help analysts and investors understand market fluctuations and make data-driven decisions.

---

##  Project Overview

This end-to-end pipeline includes:

- 📊 **Stock Data Collection** using public financial APIs
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** & processing
- 🗃️ **Storage in SQLite** database for efficient querying
- 📈 **GARCH Model** implementation for volatility forecasting
- 🔌 **Custom REST API** to serve real-time prediction.

🧠 Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- yfinance / Alpha Vantage API (or any stock data API)
- pandas, numpy
- arch for GARCH modeling
- SQLite for data storage
- FastAPI or Flask for REST API
- matplotlib, seaborn for visualization

# 🧠 **How This Project Stands Out**  
While chat apps are common, this project:  
✔ **Prioritizes Simplicity** – No unnecessary bloat; focuses on core functionality.  
✔ **Custom UI** – Clean, self-designed interface (not a template).  
✔ **Extensible** – Easy to add features (e.g., emoji picker, user profiles).  

#🔥 **Challenges Overcome**  
- **Real-time Sync**: Implemented Firestore’s `onSnapshot` for live updates.  
- **Auth-State Handling**: Managed user persistence with Firebase Auth.
